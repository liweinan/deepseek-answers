# MLflow vs Kubeflow Comparison Overview

MLflow and Kubeflow are both popular open-source platforms for managing machine learning workflows, but they have different focuses and architectures. Here's a detailed comparison:

### **1. Purpose & Scope**
| **Feature**       | **MLflow**                          | **Kubeflow**                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Experiment tracking, model management, and deployment | End-to-end ML orchestration on Kubernetes |
| **Use Case**      | Lightweight, framework-agnostic ML lifecycle management | Scalable, production-grade ML pipelines on Kubernetes |
| **Scope**         | Narrower (focused on ML tracking & deployment) | Broader (covers data prep, training, serving, etc.) |

### **2. Core Components**
| **Component**    | **MLflow**                          | **Kubeflow**                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Tracking**     | ✅ MLflow Tracking (experiments, metrics, params) | ✅ Kubeflow Metadata (experiment tracking) |
| **Projects**     | ✅ MLflow Projects (reproducible runs) | ❌ (Uses Tekton/Argo for workflows) |
| **Models**       | ✅ MLflow Models (model packaging & deployment) | ✅ Kubeflow Pipelines (custom components) |
| **Deployment**   | ✅ MLflow Model Serving (simple REST API) | ✅ KFServing, Seldon Core, TF Serving (scalable serving) |
| **Notebooks**    | ❌ (No built-in notebook support) | ✅ Kubeflow Notebooks (Jupyter integration) |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning** | ❌ (Requires integrations like Optuna) | ✅ Katib (native hyperparameter tuning) |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | ❌ (Limited to single runs) | ✅ Kubeflow Pipelines (DAG-based workflows) |

### **3. Deployment & Scalability**
| **Aspect**       | **MLflow**                          | **Kubeflow**                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Runs anywhere (local, cloud, on-prem) | Kubernetes-native (requires K8s) |
| **Scalability**  | Limited (single-server deployment) | High (distributed K8s clusters) |
| **Deployment Options** | Local, Docker, cloud (e.g., Databricks) | Kubernetes-only (GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.) |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Basic (manual or custom scripts) | Advanced (Tekton, Argo Workflows) |

### **4. Ease of Use**
| **Factor**       | **MLflow**                          | **Kubeflow**                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Learning Curve** | Low (simple Python API) | High (requires K8s knowledge) |
| **Setup**        | Quick (`pip install mlflow`) | Complex (K8s cluster + Kubeflow installation) |
| **UI**           | Basic (experiment tracking) | Rich (Pipelines, Notebooks, Dashboard) |

### **5. Ecosystem & Integrations**
| **Integration**  | **MLflow**                          | **Kubeflow**                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **ML Frameworks** | PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc. | TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, etc. |
| **Data Tools**   | Limited (mostly logging) | Integrates with Feast, Apache Beam, Spark |
| **Deployment Targets** | Local, S3, Azure ML, Databricks | Kubernetes-native (Istio, KNative) |

### **6. Best For**
- **MLflow**:
    - Small to medium teams needing experiment tracking & model management.
    - Quick prototyping and local development.
    - Simple model serving (REST API).

- **Kubeflow**:
    - Large-scale ML workflows in production.
    - Teams using Kubernetes for orchestration.
    - Complex pipelines with distributed training (TFJob, PyTorchJob).

### **When to Use Which?**
- **Choose MLflow** if you need a lightweight, easy-to-use tool for tracking experiments and deploying models without Kubernetes complexity.
- **Choose Kubeflow** if you're running large-scale ML workflows on Kubernetes and need end-to-end orchestration (data prep → training → serving).

### **Can They Work Together?**
Yes! Some teams use **MLflow for tracking experiments** and **Kubeflow for orchestration**, integrating them via:
- Logging MLflow metrics from Kubeflow Pipelines.
- Deploying MLflow models with KFServing.
