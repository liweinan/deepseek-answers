# Terraform Usage In OpenShift Installer

Iâ€™ll help you analyze the codebase to check if it uses Terraform. Let me search through the codebase.

Search files...
Let me analyze the search results to determine if and how Terraform is used in this codebase.

Based on the search results, I can confirm that this codebase does use Terraform extensively. Here are the key findings:

1. **Terraform Integration**:
    - The codebase uses Terraform as its infrastructure provisioning tool
    - It uses the `terraform-exec` library (from HashiCorp) to interact with Terraform
    - There are dedicated Terraform modules and configurations for different cloud providers (AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, OpenStack)

2. **Cloud Provider Support**:
    - AWS Terraform configurations
    - Azure Terraform configurations
    - IBM Cloud Terraform configurations
    - OpenStack Terraform configurations

3. **Key Components**:
    - `pkg/terraform/` - Contains core Terraform integration code
    - `pkg/tfvars/` - Contains code for generating Terraform variables
    - `data/data/` - Contains Terraform module definitions for different cloud providers

4. **Main Terraform Operations**:
    - Infrastructure provisioning
    - Bootstrap node creation
    - Network configuration
    - Security group setup
    - Resource tagging

5. **Terraform Version Management**:
    - The codebase supports multiple Terraform versions (from 0.4.1 up to 1.1.0)
    - It has version compatibility checks and handling

6. **Provider-Specific Implementations**:
    - Each cloud provider has its own Terraform variables and configurations
    - Custom resource definitions for each platform
    - Platform-specific Terraform modules

This appears to be an installer project that uses Terraform as its primary infrastructure provisioning tool, with support for multiple cloud providers. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between different cloud providers and Terraform operations.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of how Terraform is used in this codebase?

I'll analyze the AWS installation process to check if it uses Terraform. Let me look at the AWS-specific code.

Search files...
Let me analyze the search results to determine if the AWS installation process uses Terraform.

Based on the code analysis, I can confirm that the AWS installation process does use Terraform. Here are the key findings:

1. **Terraform Integration in AWS Installation**:
    - The codebase has a dedicated AWS Terraform implementation in `pkg/tfvars/aws/aws.go`
    - AWS-specific Terraform variables are generated through the `TFVars` function
    - The installation process includes a `PreTerraform` step for AWS in `pkg/asset/cluster/aws/aws.go`

2. **AWS Terraform Configuration**:
    - The AWS Terraform configuration handles:
        - VPC setup
        - Subnet configuration
        - IAM roles and policies
        - Security groups
        - Instance types and configurations
        - AMI management
        - Route53 integration

3. **Installation Flow**:
   ```go
   // From pkg/asset/cluster/cluster.go
   case typesaws.Name:
       if err := aws.PreTerraform(ctx, clusterID.InfraID, installConfig); err != nil {
           return err
       }
   ```
   This shows that AWS installation includes a pre-Terraform step before the main infrastructure provisioning.

4. **Terraform Variables Generation**:
    - The code generates AWS-specific Terraform variables including:
        - VPC configuration
        - Subnet information
        - IAM roles
        - Instance types
        - Security groups
        - AMI details
        - Region settings

5. **Infrastructure Management**:
    - The AWS installation uses Terraform to manage:
        - Network infrastructure
        - Compute resources
        - Security configurations
        - IAM roles and policies
        - Route53 DNS records

So yes, the AWS installation process does use Terraform as its infrastructure provisioning tool. The codebase has a well-structured implementation that uses Terraform to manage all AWS resources needed for the cluster installation.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of how Terraform is used in the AWS installation process?

# I'll help you analyze whether Ansible is used in this project. Let me search through the codebase for any Ansible-related files or references.

Search files...
Let me search for more Ansible-related files to get a complete picture.

Ran tool
Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can confirm that Ansible is indeed used in this project, primarily for infrastructure automation in two main areas:

1. OpenStack UPI (User-Provided Infrastructure) Installation:
- Located in the `upi/openstack/` directory
- Contains multiple Ansible playbooks for automating OpenStack infrastructure setup:
   - `network.yaml` - Network configuration
   - `security-groups.yaml` - Security group setup
   - `bootstrap.yaml` - Bootstrap node setup
   - `control-plane.yaml` - Control plane node setup
   - `compute-nodes.yaml` - Worker node setup
   - Various cleanup playbooks (prefixed with `down-`)

2. oVirt/RHV UPI Installation:
- Located in the `upi/ovirt/` directory
- Contains Ansible playbooks for oVirt/RHV infrastructure automation:
   - `bootstrap.yml` - Bootstrap node setup
   - `masters.yml` - Master node setup
   - `workers.yml` - Worker node setup
   - `create-templates-and-vms.yml` - VM template creation

The Ansible playbooks are used to automate various infrastructure tasks such as:
- Creating and configuring networks
- Setting up security groups
- Managing virtual machines
- Configuring load balancers
- Handling infrastructure cleanup

The project also includes Ansible-related dependencies in its Docker images, as seen in `images/openstack/Dockerfile.ci`, which installs:
- ansible-collection-ansible-netcommon
- ansible-collection-community-general
- ansible-collections-openstack

This indicates that Ansible is an integral part of the infrastructure automation strategy for both OpenStack and oVirt/RHV deployments in this project.

I'll analyze the codebase and provide key code snippets along with their workflows. Let me search for some relevant code first.

Search files...
Based on the codebase analysis, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the main workflows and code snippets. The project appears to have several key workflows:

1. **Install Workflow**
```go
// pkg/asset/agent/workflow/commons.go
const (
    AgentWorkflowTypeInstall AgentWorkflowType = "install"
    AgentWorkflowTypeAddNodes AgentWorkflowType = "addnodes"
    AgentWorkflowTypeInstallInteractiveDisconnected AgentWorkflowType = "install-interactive-disconnected"
)
```

The main installation process follows these steps:

1. **Pre-Provision Phase**:
```go
// pkg/infrastructure/aws/clusterapi/aws.go
func (*Provider) PreProvision(ctx context.Context, in clusterapi.PreProvisionInput) error {
    // Create IAM roles
    if err := createIAMRoles(ctx, in.InfraID, in.InstallConfig); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create IAM roles: %w", err)
    }
    // Copy AMI to region
    amiID, err := copyAMIToRegion(ctx, in.InstallConfig, in.InfraID, in.RhcosImage)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to copy AMI: %w", err)
    }
    // Update Machine manifests
    for i := range in.MachineManifests {
        if awsMachine, ok := in.MachineManifests[i].(*capa.AWSMachine); ok {
            awsMachine.Spec.AMI.ID = ptr.To(amiID)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

2. **Ignition Configuration**:
```go
// pkg/infrastructure/aws/clusterapi/aws.go
func (p Provider) Ignition(ctx context.Context, in clusterapi.IgnitionInput) ([]*corev1.Secret, error) {
    ignOutput, err := editIgnition(ctx, in)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to edit bootstrap master or worker ignition: %w", err)
    }
    ignSecrets := []*corev1.Secret{
        clusterapi.IgnitionSecret(ignOutput.UpdatedBootstrapIgn, in.InfraID, "bootstrap"),
        clusterapi.IgnitionSecret(ignOutput.UpdatedMasterIgn, in.InfraID, "master"),
        clusterapi.IgnitionSecret(ignOutput.UpdatedWorkerIgn, in.InfraID, "worker"),
    }
    return ignSecrets, nil
}
```

3. **Infrastructure Setup**:
```go
// pkg/infrastructure/aws/clusterapi/aws.go
func (*Provider) InfraReady(ctx context.Context, in clusterapi.InfraReadyInput) error {
    // Get AWS cluster configuration
    awsCluster := &capa.AWSCluster{}
    key := k8sClient.ObjectKey{
        Name:      in.InfraID,
        Namespace: capiutils.Namespace,
    }
    if err := in.Client.Get(ctx, key, awsCluster); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to get AWSCluster: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Create Route53 records if needed
    if in.InstallConfig.Config.AWS.UserProvisionedDNS == dns.UserProvisionedDNSEnabled {
        logrus.Debugf("User Provisioned DNS enabled, skipping dns record creation")
        return nil
    }
    // Create DNS records
    if err := client.CreateOrUpdateRecord(ctx, &awsconfig.CreateRecordInput{
        Name:           apiName,
        Region:         awsCluster.Spec.Region,
        DNSTarget:      pubLB.DNSName,
        ZoneID:         aws.StringValue(zone.Id),
        AliasZoneID:    aliasZoneID,
        HostedZoneRole: "",
    }); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create records for api in public zone: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
```

4. **Cleanup Process**:
```go
// pkg/infrastructure/aws/clusterapi/aws.go
func (p *Provider) PostDestroy(ctx context.Context, in clusterapi.PostDestroyerInput) error {
    region := in.Metadata.AWS.Region
    session, err := awsconfig.GetSessionWithOptions(
        awsconfig.WithRegion(region),
        awsconfig.WithServiceEndpoints(region, in.Metadata.AWS.ServiceEndpoints),
    )
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to create aws session: %w", err)
    }
    // Delete ignition bucket
    bucketName := awsmanifest.GetIgnitionBucketName(in.Metadata.InfraID)
    if err := removeS3Bucket(ctx, session, bucketName); err != nil {
        if p.bestEffortDeleteIgnition {
            logrus.Warnf("failed to delete ignition bucket %s: %v", bucketName, err)
            return nil
        }
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to delete ignition bucket %s: %w", bucketName, err)
    }
    return nil
}
```

The workflow is managed through a state machine that tracks the installation progress and handles various stages of the deployment process. The code includes extensive error handling and cleanup mechanisms to ensure proper resource management.

The project also includes Ansible playbooks for infrastructure automation, particularly for OpenStack and oVirt/RHV deployments, which handle tasks like:
- Network configuration
- Security group setup
- VM template creation
- Node provisioning
- Infrastructure cleanup

This modular approach allows for flexible deployment options while maintaining consistent infrastructure management across different platforms.
