# TestDome - Boat Movements(Java)

- https://www.testdome.com/library?page=1&skillArea=30&questionId=134845

Thank you for pointing out the potential optimization regarding the `moves` array! You're correct that making the `int[][] moves` array `static` could improve efficiency by avoiding repeated initialization. Below, I'll address this suggestion, analyze other potential optimizations in the provided `canTravelTo` function, and provide an updated, optimized version of the code with detailed comments explaining the changes. I'll also ensure the solution remains correct for the turn-based strategy game, where the boat moves through water cells (`true` in `gameMatrix`) to reach a destination using paths like "up - right - up" via DFS.

### 1. Making the `moves` Array Static

#### Issue
The `moves` array is currently defined inside the `dfs` method:
```java
int[][] moves = {
    {-1, 0}, // Up
    {1, 0},  // Down
    {0, -1}, // Left
    {0, 1}   // Right
};
```
- **Problem**: Every time `dfs` is called recursively, a new `moves` array is created on the stack, which is unnecessary since the array is constant (same values for all calls).
- **Impact**: For a small array (4 elements), the overhead is minimal, but in deep recursion (e.g., large grids or complex paths), repeated allocations could add up, especially in performance-critical applications.
- **Solution**: Declare `moves` as a `static final` field at the class level to create it once and reuse it across all `dfs` calls.

#### Optimization
Move the `moves` array to a `static final` field:
```java
private static final int[][] MOVES = {
    {-1, 0}, // Up
    {1, 0},  // Down
    {0, -1}, // Left
    {0, 1}   // Right
};
```
- **Benefits**:
    - Single allocation at class loading time.
    - Reduces stack memory usage per recursive call.
    - Improves performance slightly, especially for deep recursion.
- **Consideration**: `final` ensures the array is immutable (though the array’s contents could still be modified; since we don’t modify `MOVES`, this is safe).

### 2. Analyzing Other Optimization Opportunities

Let’s examine the entire `canTravelTo` function to identify other areas for optimization, focusing on performance, memory usage, and code clarity while ensuring correctness for the pathfinding problem.

#### Current Code (for Reference)
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canTravelTo(boolean[][] gameMatrix, int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol) {
        if (!isValidPosition(gameMatrix, startRow, startCol) || !isValidPosition(gameMatrix, endRow, endCol)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!gameMatrix[startRow][startCol] || !gameMatrix[endRow][endCol]) {
            return false;
        }
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        return dfs(gameMatrix, startRow, startCol, endRow, endCol, visited);
    }

    private boolean dfs(boolean[][] gameMatrix, int row, int col, int endRow, int endCol, Set<String> visited) {
        if (row == endRow && col == endCol) {
            return true;
        }
        String pos = row + "," + col;
        visited.add(pos);
        int[][] moves = {
            {-1, 0}, // Up
            {1, 0},  // Down
            {0, -1}, // Left
            {0, 1}   // Right
        };
        for (int[] move : moves) {
            int newRow = row + move[0];
            int newCol = col + move[1];
            String newPos = newRow + "," + newCol;
            if (isValidPosition(gameMatrix, newRow, newCol) && 
                gameMatrix[newRow][newCol] && 
                !visited.contains(newPos)) {
                if (dfs(gameMatrix, newRow, newCol, endRow, endCol, visited)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isValidPosition(boolean[][] gameMatrix, int row, int col) {
        return row >= 0 && row < gameMatrix.length && col >= 0 && col < gameMatrix[0].length;
    }
}
```

#### Optimization Areas
I’ll analyze the code line-by-line and suggest improvements:

1. **Visited Set Representation (`Set<String>`)**:
    - **Issue**: The `visited` set uses strings (`"row,col"`) to represent positions, created via `row + "," + col`.
    - **Problem**:
        - String concatenation is relatively expensive (creates new `String` objects).
        - `HashSet<String>` involves string hashing, which is slower than integer-based hashing.
        - Memory overhead from storing strings.
    - **Optimization**: Use a `boolean[][]` array or `Set<long>` (packing `row` and `col` into a `long`) for visited positions.
        - **Option 1: `boolean[][] visited`**:
            - Create a `boolean[gameMatrix.length][gameMatrix[0].length]` array.
            - Mark `visited[row][col] = true` instead of adding to a set.
            - Pros: Fast access (O(1)), no hashing, minimal memory (1 bit per cell).
            - Cons: Slightly higher initial memory for small grids with few visited cells; not thread-safe if reused.
        - **Option 2: `Set<long>`**:
            - Pack `row` and `col` into a `long` (e.g., `(long)row << 32 | col`).
            - Pros: Flexible, no string overhead.
            - Cons: Slightly slower due to bitwise operations and `HashSet` hashing.
        - **Recommendation**: Use `boolean[][]` for simplicity and speed, as the grid is small (e.g., 6x6).
    - **Impact**: Reduces string creation/hashing overhead, improves runtime and memory usage.

2. **String Creation for `newPos`**:
    - **Issue**: `String newPos = newRow + "," + newCol` creates a new string for each neighbor check.
    - **Problem**: Similar to `pos`, this adds unnecessary string allocation and hashing costs.
    - **Optimization**: With `boolean[][] visited`, we can check `visited[newRow][newCol]` directly, eliminating `newPos`.
    - **Impact**: Further reduces string overhead, aligns with the `visited` optimization.

3. **Redundant Bounds Check**:
    - **Issue**: `canTravelTo` calls `isValidPosition` twice (for start and end), and `dfs` calls it again for each neighbor.
    - **Problem**: While the checks are necessary, we could avoid one call in `canTravelTo` by combining with the water check.
    - **Optimization**: Merge bounds and water checks in `canTravelTo`:
      ```java
      if (startRow < 0 || startRow >= gameMatrix.length || startCol < 0 || startCol >= gameMatrix[0].length || !gameMatrix[startRow][startCol] ||
          endRow < 0 || endRow >= gameMatrix.length || endCol < 0 || endCol >= gameMatrix[0].length || !gameMatrix[endRow][endCol]) {
          return false;
      }
      ```
        - Pros: Eliminates `isValidPosition` calls in `canTravelTo`, slightly faster.
        - Cons: Slightly less readable; `isValidPosition` is reused in `dfs`, so keep it for consistency.
        - **Recommendation**: Keep `isValidPosition` for clarity, as the performance gain is minimal for small grids.

4. **Visited Set Allocation**:
    - **Issue**: A new `HashSet<String>` is created for each `canTravelTo` call.
    - **Problem**: If `canTravelTo` is called repeatedly, allocating new sets adds overhead.
    - **Optimization**: Reuse a `boolean[][] visited` array, clearing it (or creating once per call). Since `boolean[][]` is fixed-size, it’s efficient.
        - Clear array: Set `visited[row][col] = false` after DFS (not needed if recreated).
        - **Recommendation**: Create `visited` array per call, as grid is small and clearing adds complexity.

5. **Early Pruning with Manhattan Distance**:
    - **Issue**: DFS explores all possible paths, even those moving away from the destination.
    - **Optimization**: Add a heuristic check (e.g., Manhattan distance) to prune branches where the current position is too far from the destination to reach it within a reasonable number of steps.
        - Example: If `|row - endRow| + |col - endCol| > maxSteps`, skip the branch.
        - Problem: The problem doesn’t specify a maximum path length (e.g., "up - right - up" is 3 steps, but others could be longer).
        - **Recommendation**: Skip this unless a step limit is confirmed, as it adds complexity and may prune valid paths.

6. **Avoiding Recursion for Small Grids**:
    - **Issue**: Recursive DFS uses stack space, which could be avoided for small grids (e.g., 6x6).
    - **Optimization**: Use an iterative DFS with a `Stack` for control flow.
        - Pros: Avoids recursion overhead, explicit control.
        - Cons: More complex code, minimal gain for small grids (recursion depth ≤ 36).
        - **Recommendation**: Keep recursive DFS for simplicity, as stack overflow is unlikely.

7. **Code Clarity and Maintainability**:
    - **Issue**: Variable names and comments could be clearer to reflect intent.
    - **Optimization**:
        - Rename `gameMatrix` to `grid` for brevity.
        - Add comments explaining DFS’s role in pathfinding.
        - Use constants for directions (e.g., `UP`, `DOWN`) if `MOVES` expands.
        - **Recommendation**: Apply these for readability, minimal performance impact.

### 3. Optimized Code
Below is the optimized version of the code, incorporating:
- `static final MOVES` array.
- `boolean[][] visited` instead of `Set<String>`.
- Merged bounds/water checks in `canTravelTo` for slight efficiency.
- Improved comments for clarity.
- Kept recursive DFS and `isValidPosition` for simplicity and readability.

```java
public class Solution {
    // Define cardinal moves as a static final array to avoid repeated initialization
    // Represents directions: up, down, left, right
    private static final int[][] MOVES = {
        {-1, 0}, // Up
        {1, 0},  // Down
        {0, -1}, // Left
        {0, 1}   // Right
    };

    public boolean canTravelTo(boolean[][] grid, int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol) {
        // Check if start and end positions are valid (within bounds and water)
        if (startRow < 0 || startRow >= grid.length || startCol < 0 || startCol >= grid[0].length || !grid[startRow][startCol] ||
            endRow < 0 || endRow >= grid.length || endCol < 0 || endCol >= grid[0].length || !grid[endRow][endCol]) {
            return false; // Return false if out of bounds or on land
        }

        // Create visited array to track explored cells, avoiding string overhead
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        return dfs(grid, startRow, startCol, endRow, endCol, visited);
    }

    // Depth-First Search to find a path from (row, col) to (endRow, endCol) through water cells
    private boolean dfs(boolean[][] grid, int row, int col, int endRow, int endCol, boolean[][] visited) {
        // If current position is the destination, a valid path is found
        if (row == endRow && col == endCol) {
            return true;
        }

        // Mark current position as visited
        visited[row][col] = true;

        // Explore each cardinal direction
        for (int[] move : MOVES) {
            int newRow = row + move[0];
            int newCol = col + move[1];

            // Check if new position is valid: within bounds, water, and not visited
            if (isValidPosition(grid, newRow, newCol) && grid[newRow][newCol] && !visited[newRow][newCol]) {
                // Recursively explore the new position
                if (dfs(grid, newRow, newCol, endRow, endCol, visited)) {
                    return true; // Found a path
                }
            }
        }

        // No valid path found from this position
        return false;
    }

    // Helper function to check if a position is within grid boundaries
    private boolean isValidPosition(boolean[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        return row >= 0 && row < grid.length && col >= 0 && col < grid[0].length;
    }
}
```

### 4. Optimization Summary
- **Static `MOVES` Array**:
    - Moved to `static final int[][] MOVES` at class level.
    - Benefit: Eliminates repeated array creation, saves stack memory.
- **Visited Representation**:
    - Replaced `Set<String>` with `boolean[][] visited`.
    - Benefit: Removes string concatenation/hashing, faster O(1) access, lower memory usage.
- **Merged Checks**:
    - Combined bounds and water checks in `canTravelTo`.
    - Benefit: Slightly reduces function call overhead, maintains clarity.
- **Kept Recursive DFS**:
    - Reason: Simple, effective for small grids (e.g., 6x6), low risk of stack overflow.
- **Improved Naming/Comments**:
    - Renamed `gameMatrix` to `grid` for brevity.
    - Added clearer comments explaining DFS and optimizations.
- **Rejected Optimizations** (with reasons):
    - Manhattan distance pruning: No step limit specified, risks pruning valid paths.
    - Iterative DFS: Adds complexity, minimal gain for small grids.
    - Reusing `visited` array: Clearing adds overhead, new array is simple for small grids.

### 5. Correctness for the Problem
The optimized code remains correct for the turn-based strategy game:
- **Pathfinding**: DFS explores all possible paths (e.g., "up - right - up") via cardinal moves (up, down, left, right).
- **Constraints**:
    - Checks bounds (`isValidPosition`).
    - Ensures water cells (`grid[row][col]`).
    - Avoids cycles (`visited`).
- **Example Cases**:
    - `(3, 2)` to `(2, 2)`: Returns `true` (single "up" step, water).
    - `(3, 2)` to `(3, 4)`: Returns `false` (path blocked by land at `(3, 3)`).
    - `(3, 2)` to `(6, 2)`: Returns `false` (out of bounds).
- **Farther Destinations**: Handles arbitrary destinations via DFS, as long as a valid water path exists.

### 6. Performance Impact
- **Runtime**: O(V + E), where V is the number of cells (rows × cols) and E is the number of edges (4 per cell). Worst case explores all reachable water cells, but pruning (visited, water checks) reduces practical runtime.
- **Memory**: O(rows × cols) for `visited` array and recursion stack. Optimized from `Set<String>` to `boolean[][]`, reducing memory and improving access speed.
- **Small Grids**: For 6x6 grids, optimizations (e.g., `boolean[][]`, static `MOVES`) ensure minimal overhead, though gains are small due to the problem’s scale.

### 7. Further Optimizations (If Needed)
If additional constraints or performance requirements arise, consider:
- **Step Limit**: Add a `maxSteps` parameter to DFS if paths like "up - right - up" are limited to 3 steps:
  ```java
  private boolean dfs(..., int steps, int maxSteps) {
      if (steps > maxSteps) return false;
      // Pass steps + 1 in recursive call
  }
  ```
- **BFS Alternative**: If shortest path is needed, switch to BFS (higher memory, guarantees shortest path).
- **BitSet for Visited**: For very large grids, use `BitSet` instead of `boolean[][]` to reduce memory (1 bit vs. 8 bits per cell).
- **Precompute Water Regions**: If `canTravelTo` is called multiple times, precompute connected water regions (e.g., via flood-fill) to cache reachability.

### 8. Clarifications Needed
To confirm the optimizations are optimal:
- **Grid Size**: Is 6x6 typical, or should we optimize for larger grids (e.g., 100x100)?
- **Path Length**: Are there limits on path length (e.g., max 3 steps)?
- **Move Types**: Are only cardinal moves allowed, or others (e.g., diagonals)?
- **Performance Requirements**: Is runtime or memory critical, or is simplicity preferred?

### Conclusion
The suggestion to make `moves` static was spot-on and has been implemented as `static final MOVES`. Additional optimizations include using `boolean[][] visited`, merging checks, and improving clarity. The code remains correct, efficient for small grids, and flexible for paths like "up - right - up." If you have specific constraints (e.g., step limits) or need further optimizations (e.g., BFS), please let me know, and I can provide tailored updates!
