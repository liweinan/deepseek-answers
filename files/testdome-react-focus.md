# Let’s solve this step-by-step to implement the `FocusableInput` component correctly, ensuring that the input receives focus when the `focused` prop is initially `true` or changes from `false` to `true`.

- [TestDome - React - Focus](https://www.testdome.com/library?page=1&skillArea=48&questionId=104185)

The requirements are:
1. When the component mounts, if the `focused` prop is `true`, the input should receive focus.
2. When the `focused` prop changes from `false` to `true`, and the input is not already focused, it should receive focus.

Here’s the corrected implementation:

### Explanation of Changes
1. **componentDidMount**:
    - Checks if the `focused` prop is `true` when the component mounts.
    - If `true`, calls `this.ref.current.focus()` to focus the input.
    - Uses `this.ref.current` to access the DOM input element via the ref.

2. **componentDidUpdate**:
    - Compares the previous `focused` prop (`prevProps.focused`) with the current `focused` prop (`this.props.focused`).
    - If the prop changes from `false` to `true`, checks if the input is not already focused by comparing `document.activeElement` with `this.ref.current`.
    - If the input is not focused, calls `this.ref.current.focus()` to focus it.

3. **Existing Code**:
    - The `ref` is already created with `React.createRef()` and passed to `TextInput`, which forwards it to the underlying `input` element.
    - The `render` method correctly renders `TextInput` with the ref.
    - `defaultProps` sets `focused` to `false`, which is fine as a default.

### Corrected Code
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

class Input extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    let {forwardedRef, ...otherProps} = this.props; 
    return <input {...otherProps} ref={forwardedRef} />;
  }
}

const TextInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <Input {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />
});

class FocusableInput extends React.Component {
  ref = React.createRef();

  render() {
    return <TextInput ref={this.ref} />;
  }

  // When the focused prop is changed from false to true, 
  // and the input is not focused, it should receive focus.
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (!prevProps.focused && this.props.focused && document.activeElement !== this.ref.current) {
      this.ref.current.focus();
    }
  }
  
  // If focused prop is true on mount, the input should receive the focus.
  componentDidMount() {
    if (this.props.focused) {
      this.ref.current.focus();
    }
  }
}

FocusableInput.defaultProps = {
  focused: false
};

const App = (props) => <FocusableInput focused={props.focused} />;

document.body.innerHTML = "<div id='root'></div>";
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

### Why the Original Attempt Failed
The error messages indicate:
- **"The focused property has an initial state of true: Wrong answer"**: This suggests the test expects the input to be focused when `focused` is initially `true`. The `componentDidMount` implementation ensures this by checking `this.props.focused` and focusing the input if `true`.
- **"Changing the focused prop from false to true focuses the input: Wrong answer"**: This indicates the `componentDidUpdate` logic was missing or incorrect. The new implementation checks for the transition from `false` to `true` and ensures the input isn’t already focused before calling `focus()`.

### Additional Notes
- The `document.activeElement !== this.ref.current` check in `componentDidUpdate` prevents unnecessary focus calls if the input is already focused, adhering to the requirement that focus should only be set if the input is not focused.
- The `TextInput` and `Input` components are correctly set up to forward the ref to the native `input` element, so no changes are needed there.
- The `defaultProps` setting `focused: false` is appropriate, as it provides a default value when the prop isn’t specified.

This implementation should satisfy the requirements and pass the tests. Let me know if you need further clarification or testing guidance!
