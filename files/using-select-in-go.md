# Using `select` in Go

The `select` statement in Go lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations (channel sends or receives). It blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. If multiple cases are ready, it chooses one at random.

## Basic Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		ch1 <- "from channel 1"
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		ch2 <- "from channel 2"
	}()

	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-ch1:
			fmt.Println("Received:", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-ch2:
			fmt.Println("Received:", msg2)
		}
	}
}
```

## Example with Timeout

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
		ch <- "result"
	}()

	select {
	case res := <-ch:
		fmt.Println(res)
	case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("timeout")
	}
}
```

## Example with Default Case

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 1)

	// This select will run the default case immediately
	// because the channel isn't ready
	select {
	case <-ch:
		fmt.Println("received from channel")
	default:
		fmt.Println("nothing received")
	}

	// Now send a value
	ch <- 42

	// This select will receive the value
	select {
	case val := <-ch:
		fmt.Println("received value:", val)
	default:
		fmt.Println("nothing received")
	}
}
```

The `select` statement is particularly useful when working with multiple channels or when you need to implement timeouts or non-blocking channel operations.
